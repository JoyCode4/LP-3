Introduction to Fibonacci numbers
● The Fibonacci series, named after Italian mathematician Leonardo Pisano Bogollo, later
known as Fibonacci, is a series (sum) formed by Fibonacci numbers denoted as Fn. The numbers in
Fibonacci sequence are given as: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 38, . . .
● In a Fibonacci series, every term is the sum of the preceding two terms, starting from 0 and 1
as first and second terms. In some old references, the term '0' might be omitted.
What is the Fibonacci Series?
● The Fibonacci series is the sequence of numbers (also called Fibonacci numbers), where
every number is the sum of the preceding two numbers, such that the first two terms are '0' and '1'.
● In some older versions of the series, the term '0' might be omitted. A Fibonacci series can thus
be given as, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . It can be thus be observed that every term can be
calculated by adding the two terms before it.
● Given the first term, F0 and second term, F1 as '0' and '1', the third term here can be given as,
F2 = 0 + 1 = 1
Similarly,
F3 = 1 + 1 = 2
F4 = 2 + 1 = 3
Given a number n, print n-th Fibonacci Number.

Fibonacci Sequence Formula
The Fibonacci sequence of numbers “Fn” is defined using the recursive relation with the seed values
F0=0 and F1=1:
Fn = Fn-1+Fn-2
Here, the sequence is defined using two different parts, such as kick-off and recursive relation.
The kick-off part is F0=0 and F1=1.
The recursive relation part is Fn = Fn-1+Fn-2.
It is noted that the sequence starts with 0 rather than 1. So, F5 should be the 6th term of the sequence.
Examples:
Input : n = 2
Output : 1
Input : n = 9
Output : 34
The list of Fibonacci numbers are calculated as follows:
Fn Fibonacci Number
0 0
1 1
2 1
3 2
4 3
5 5
7 13
8 21
9 34
… and so on. … and so on.
Method 1 (Use Non-recursion)
A simple method that is a direct recursive implementation of mathematical recurrence relation is
given above.
First, we’ll store 0 and 1 in F[0] and F[1], respectively.
Next, we’ll iterate through array positions 2 to n-1. At each position i, we store the sum of the two
preceding array values in F[i].
Finally, we return the value of F[n-1], giving us the number at position n in the sequence.
Here’s a visual representation of this process:
