****************************************************************************************************************************************
Follow the given steps to solve the problem using the above approach:

Calculate the ratio (profit/weight) for each item.
Sort all the items in decreasing order of the ratio.
Initialize res = 0, curr_cap = given_cap.
Do the following for every item i in the sorted order:
If the weight of the current item is less than or equal to the remaining capacity then add the value of that item into the result
Else add the current item as much as we can and break out of the loop.
Return res.

Knapsack Problem Variants
Knapsack problem has the following two variants1. Fractional Knapsack Problem
2. 0/1 Knapsack Problem
Fractional Knapsack ProblemIn Fractional Knapsack Problem,
● As the name suggests, items are divisible here.
● We can even put the fraction of any item into the knapsack if taking the complete item is not

possible.
● It is solved using the Greedy Method.
Fractional Knapsack Problem Using Greedy MethodFractional knapsack problem is solved using greedy method in the following stepsStep-01:
For each item, compute its value / weight ratio.
Step-02:
Arrange all the items in decreasing order of their value / weight ratio.
Step-03:
Start putting the items into the knapsack beginning from the item with the highest ratio.
Put as many items as you can into the knapsack.
